      <p>
        It has been two long years since I have been able to post photos from Italy, but Iâ€™m back, even if it is just for one short month. I arrived in Italy a week ago, and we started my first week by visiting the monthly outdoor antique market in Pissignano. Next we headed to Montefalco to dine at one of our favorite restaurants for lunch, and Friday we headed to Florence for a very short one night stay. I've missed Italy so much the past two years, so it is important to me to try and squeeze in as much as I can into my month in Italy. The above photo is from the rooftop bar at Hotel Baglioni in Florence. It is the hotel we often stay at in Florence because they accept dogs, have parking, it is affordable, and it truly is a lovely hotel! Dreary skies created an amazing backdrop for the terracotta rooftops.
