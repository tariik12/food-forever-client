                For the last two centuries Badia a Coltibuono, originally a medieval Benedictine abbey, has been the gracious villa and prestigious wine estate of the Stucchi-Prinetti family. And, for the last fifteen years it was the setting for Lorenza de Medici's weeklong Villa Table cooking classes. In 2002 two new programs are being introduced: Tastes of Tuscany: A Gastronomic Sojourn in Chianti and Cooking Classes at Badia a Coltibuono. The principals of the programs are guide John Meis and chef Paolo Pancotti. Meis, a longtime resident of Tuscany, is the author of A Taste of Tuscany and collaborator with Lorenza de Medici in the Villa Table cooking program and numerous cookbooks. An experienced leader of food, wine and art tours, he is a knowledgeable and entertaining guide. Pancotti, chef at the esteemed wine estate, continues the renowned Coltibuono culinary tradition established by Lorenza de Medici, adding his personal approach and professional experience from some of Italy's best restaurants. During their sojourn guests stay in comfortable rooms located along the characteristic fourteenth century corridor of the ancient abbey. Each room enjoys a delightful view and a private bathroom. There is also time to relax in the magnificent frescoed drawing room, read in the extensive library, stroll in the gardens, enjoy the swimming pool, and walk in the vast woods that surround Coltibuono
